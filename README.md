# Real Time Face Detection using TensorFlow and Python
Overview

Welcome to the Face Detection Model tutorial using TensorFlow and Python! This repository provides a comprehensive guide and code for building a face detection model using an Object Detection architecture. The project is structured into several chapters:
START

  # Introduction to the project and its objectives.

Explainer

  A brief explanation of the face detection model, its importance, and the underlying concepts.


# PART 1 - COLLECT IMAGES & ANNOTATE

1.1 Setting up and Getting Data

   Image collection and dataset acquisition.


# PART 2 - PARTITION & AUGMENT DATA

2.1 Review dataset and build Image Loading Function

   Overview of the dataset and creation of an image loading function.

2.2 Partition Unaugmented Data

   Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

2.3 Apply Image Augmentation on Images and Labels

2.4 Build and Run Augmentation Pipeline

   Implementation and execution of the image augmentation pipeline.

2.5 Prepare Labels

   Preprocessing and formatting of labels for model input.

2.6 Combine Label and Image Samples

   Combining image samples with their corresponding labels.


# PART 3 - BUILD & TRAIN THE DEEP LEARNING MODEL

3.1 Build a Deep Learning Model using the Functional API

   Creating the face detection model using TensorFlow's Functional API.

3.2 Defining a Custom Loss Function & Optimizer

   Introduction to custom loss functions and optimizers for model training.

3.3 Train a Neural Network

   Training the deep learning model with the prepared dataset.
